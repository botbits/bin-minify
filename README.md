> Add non-standard binaries to your projects.


## Overview

`bin-minify` reduces the size of binaries by removing hard/soft links and duplicate files, in a step called `staging`. Once the binaries are `staged` they are packed (e.g. npm module, AWS Lambda) and deployed. At `run-time` links are created to rebuild the file system structure before the binaries are used.

This is specially important when needing to `zip` your files, as hard/soft links are not preserved (but replicated) by `zip`ping them.


## Other Uses

While `bin-minify` was originally created to address use cases involving binaries, its current implementation allows it to be used to solve other use cases (e.g. photo management).

[Please open an issue](https://github.com/botbits/bin-minify/issues) with suggestions on how to use `bin-minify` to address additional use cases.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save bin-minify
```


## Usage

### Staging

Before using `bin-minify` the binaries (e.g. from a tar file or a build from source (maybe from [`bin-build`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bin-build)) should be placed in the desired destination (typically `vendor` or `bin` folders).

With the binaries in place, they now should be analyzed, creating their ***minimal*** link representation (a.k.a. `minPack`) for future use (at `run-time`).

```js
const path = require('path');
const StagingBin = require('bin-minify').StagingBin;
const BIN_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, path.join('bin', 'bin-minify'));

var stagingBin = new StagingBin({
    targetPath: BIN_PATH,
});

stagingBin.createMinPack().then(result => {
  // result should be persisted in a source controlled file for future use
}, error => {
  // something went wrong
});
```

Before removing the "***extra baggage***" from the binaries analyzed, it is recommended to check that the link representation provided correctly rebuilds the original file system structure of the binaries.

```js
const RuntimeBin = require('bin-minify').RuntimeBin;

const fromBase = path.join('/', 'tmp', 'bin-minify');

var runtimeBin = new RuntimeBin({
  targetPath: BIN_PATH,
  minPack: require('MY_MIN_PACK_FILE'),
  useSymlinks: true,
});

runtimeBin.applyMinPack(fromBase).then(result => {
  // link structure was created or fromBase already exists will "diff" both
  stagingBin.checkMinPack(fromBase).then(result => {
    if (result.length > 0) // folders are different, check the original binaries for empty folders
    else // folders match, it is safe to clean up the original binaries
  }, error => {
    // checkMinPack() failed
  });
}, error => {
  // applyMinPack() failed
});
```

Once all looks good (folders match) it is time to remove all unnecessary files from the original binary folder.

```js
const sendToTrash = false;
stagingBin.minifyBin(sendToTrash).then(result => {
  // redundant files were removed from the original binary folder
}, error => {
  // minifyBin() failed
});
```

**Note**: If you plan to create a npm package, [avoid packaging undesired files](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/165769683050/publishing-what-you-mean-to-publish) (e.g. tar/zip files) by using `files` section in your `package.json`.

The sample `files` section below assumes your links representation is stored in the `.bin-minify` folder and you binaries and in the `bin` folder.

```json
"files": [
  "/.bin-minify",
  "/bin",
  "other source code locations"
],
```

### Run-time

Use the link representation generated during `staging` to rebuild the file system structure before invoking the binaries.

```js
const RuntimeBin = require('bin-minify').RuntimeBin;

const fromBase = path.join('/', 'tmp', 'bin-minify');

var runtimeBin = new RuntimeBin({
  targetPath: BIN_PATH,
  minPack: require('MY_MIN_PACK_FILE'),
  useSymlinks: true,
});

runtimeBin.applyMinPack(fromBase).then(result => {
  // link structure is ready or fromBase already exists
  // Time to configure PATH and any other environment variables
}, error => {
  // applyMinPack() failed
});
```

Consider using [`lambda-bin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambda-bin) for a smaller module footprint and environment variable helper functions.


## API

### StagingBin

#### constructor (options)
```javascript
Object new StagingBin( Object )
```

##### options

Type: `Object`
Optional

The following are supported keys in the `options` `json` object. Any other keys are ignored.

###### targetPath

Type: `string`
Default: `./bin/bin-minify`

Location of the actual binaries.

**Note**: Typically the binaries under `targetPath` are source controlled (and should be included in the `npm` module or `Lambda` package).

###### relativeSymlinks

Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

If `true`, the symlinks found will be interpreted as relative to their current location.

If `false` the symlinks found will be interpreted as absolute paths.

###### minPack

Type: `Object`
Default: `{}`

Used to ***load*** a previously created `minPack`.

**Note**: `minPack` is particularly useful for integrating the various `staging` steps into your workflow (e.g. using `gulp` or `grunt`) and for internal `bin-minify` testing.

#### Promise stagingBin.createMinPack ()

Analyzes all files under `stagingBin.targetPath` to create their `minPack`.

##### returns Promise

Resolved Promise: `minPack` JSON.

**Note**: It is recommended to store this `minPack` JSON to a source controlled file for future use.

Rejected Promise: `{ error }`.

#### Promise stagingBin.checkMinPack (linksPath)

##### linksPath

Type: `string`
Default: `/tmp/bin-minify`

Compares the files under `linksPath` to the ones under `stagingBin.targetPath`.

**Note**: To check if the `minPack` is correct, the files under `linksPath` should be created by invoking `runtimeBin.applyMinPack(linksPath)` before `checkMinPack()`.

##### returns Promise

Resolved Promise: `Array` compliant with the [`fs-tree-diff.calculatePatch()` format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-tree-diff).

Rejected Promise: `{ error }`.

#### Promise stagingBin.minifyBin (sendToTrash)

##### sendToTrash

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

If `true`, all redundant files under `stagingBin.targetPath` will be removed by sending them to the trash.

If `false`, all redundant files under `stagingBin.targetPath` will be permanently removed.

##### returns Promise

Resolved Promise: `Object` as follows:

```json
{
  "delCount": "number of files removed",
  "files": [
    [
      "full path of file removed",
      "full path of file removed",
    ],
    []
  ]
}
```

Rejected Promise: `{ error }`.

### RuntimeBin

#### constructor (options)
```javascript
Object new RuntimeBin( Object )
```

##### options

Type: `Object`
Optional

The following are supported keys in the `options` `json` object. Any other keys are ignored.

###### targetPath

Type: `string`
Default: `./bin/bin-minify`

Location of the actual binaries.

**Note**: Typically the binaries under `targetPath` are source controlled (and should be included in the `npm` module or `Lambda` package).

###### useSymlinks

Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

If `true`, invoking `runtimeBin.applyMinPack()` will create symlinks (a.k.a. soft links).

If `false`, invoking `runtimeBin.applyMinPack()` will create hard links.

###### minPack

Type: `Object`
Default: `{}`

Used to ***load*** a previously created `minPack`.

#### Promise runtimeBin.applyMinPack (fromBase)

##### fromBase

Type: `string`
Required

Base path where the original file structure of the binaries will be recreated.

##### returns Promise

Resolved Promise: `{ loaded: true or false }`. `loaded` will be:
- `true` if the file structure was successfully created.
- `false` if the `fromBase` path already existed.

Rejected Promise: `{ error }`.


## Performance

The `run-time` code has been tuned to speed up its operation.

Check out this [sample](TBD) (uses [serverless](TBD) & [artillery](TBD)) if you are interested in checking the `bin-minify` or `lambda-bin` performance impact to your code.
